# COMP-5350
Introduction to Digital Forensics with Farah Kandah

## **Project 1:** 
For this project, you will focus on the analysis of FAT16 and NTFS partitions and will require an understanding of how to recover data from each properly. You will be working on a team of two, where you will be provided with a disk image Download disk image that was collected from a laptop during a forensics investigation. This investigation will require you to critically evaluate and analyze digital artifacts on the laptop. The overall objective of this project is to recover data and determine if there is proof of any criminal activity.

## **Project 2:** 
In Project #1 our focus was on understanding file system structures and recovering user generated files. In this project instead of using a step-by-step process based on file system boundaries, we will recover files by making use of file signatures. The objective of Project #2 is to develop a Python script that will:

- take a disk image Download disk imageas an input,
- locate file signatures,
- properly recover user generated files without corruption, and
- generate a SHA-256 hash for each file recovered.

You will be provided with a disk image named Project2.dd which will contain several file types:

- MPG
- PDF
- BMP
- GIF
- JPG
- DOCX
- AVI
- PNG


## **Project 3 pt 1:** 
You will be provided a forensically collected copy of a Windows 10 registry named “Win10Reg.7z Download Win10Reg.7z”.

Your task is to use any tool or technique discussed in class to find the following information:

- How many users and groups are associated with this system according to the Security Accounts Manager?
- What are the names of the users associated with this registry?
- When did the user aubie last log in to the system?
- What applications are automatically started when the user logs into the system and when was the last time the autostart was run?
- What was the private IP address associated with the system?
- What are the most recently executed commands from the Windows Run command window?


## **Project 3 pt 2:** 
Objective: Explore and understand the role, impact, and future implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital forensics.
